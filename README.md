## Step-by-Step Process

### Requirement Gathering & Use-Case Definition
- Defined key stakeholders (HR managers, leadership) and their analytical pain points.
- Outlined objective: provide quick insights into attrition rates, diversity, performance distribution, and hiring backlog.

### Data Preparation & Generation
- Downloaded “HumanResources.csv”.
- Cleaned, standardized, and formatted columns (e.g., dates, department names, performance scores).

### Wireframing & Mockups
- Sketched dashboard layouts identifying summary vs detail sections.
- Included “summary” view with high-level KPIs and “employee-level drill-down” view.

### Tableau Dashboard Design
- Built a polished summary dashboard with charts:
  - Headcount trends & attrition rates
  - Breakdown by department, gender, and years of service
  - Performance ratings distribution
  - Hiring need heatmap
- Created drill-down view:
  - Filters for department, job role, tenure
  - Detailed employee table with metrics and flags

### Interactivity & UX Enhancements
- Added interactive filters and parameter selectors (e.g., department, performance, tenure range).
- Styled using thoughtful color schemes and background images to enhance usability and aesthetics.

### Validation & Iteration
- Cross-verified dashboard metrics vs source data for accuracy.
- Incorporated feedback from peers/stakeholders to refine filtering logic, chart types, and layout.

### Publishing & Presentation
- Published final `.twbx` workbook to Tableau Public or Server.
- Converted dashboard into a sharable format; presented to mentors or peer group, demonstrating interactive features and actionable insights.
